                “It was all but inevitable” the watchers might tell us if we met them, that from the great diversity of large animals, one species or another would eventually gain intelligent control of Earth. 

                That role has fallen to Homo sapiens, a primate risen in Africa from a lineage that split away from the chimpanzee line five to eight million years ago. Unlike any creature that lived before, we have become a geophysical force, swiftly changing the atmospliere and climate as well as the composition of the world›s fauna and flora.
                 Now in the midst of a population explosion, the human species has doubled to
